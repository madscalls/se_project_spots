# Technologies and Student experience

This has definetley been an exciting learning experience for me! I was introduced to grid display and very much enjoy it. However combining flex properties and grid layout together was most defintley challenging.

Differentation between media querys can definetley make your head spin.

To further elaborate we have a grid layout for the posts with the use of the auto-fit function. The media-querys specify that at certain widths such as a smart device which would be much smaller than a desktop, we will shift the posts and the profile to fit the users screen for optimal user accsesibilty.

Also the use of elipses on text overflow for the profile description and for titles is helpful for is users have a little too much to say.

Thank you for reveiwing my project and I will continue on learning!
